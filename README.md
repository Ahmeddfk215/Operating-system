## OS Installation

This section provides a complete guide for installing the Linux Lite operating system in a virtual environment using VirtualBox. It includes steps for setting up the virtual machine, allocating resources, and completing the installation process. Common issues like system freezes were resolved by adjusting memory and processor settings. It also discusses system requirements, supported filesystems, and advantages/disadvantages of using Linux Lite.

## mkdir() System Call Implementation

This section demonstrates the implementation of the `mkdir()` system call in the Linux Lite environment using the C programming language. It explains the necessary headers, permission flags, compilation using `gcc`, and execution via terminal. The sample code creates a directory and prints success or failure based on the result. This is ideal for learners exploring filesystem-level system calls in Linux-based systems.
