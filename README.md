## Introduction üñ•Ô∏è

Operating systems are the backbone of computer functionality. They manage hardware resources and provide services for application software. This repository specifically deals with Linux Lite, a lightweight Linux distribution, and the implementation of the `mkdir()` system call, which is essential for creating directories in a file system.

### Why Linux Lite?

Linux Lite is designed to be easy to use and lightweight, making it an ideal choice for users transitioning from Windows or those who need a fast, efficient operating system. Its simplicity and user-friendly interface allow users to focus on their tasks without being overwhelmed by complexity.

### What is `mkdir()`?

The `mkdir()` system call is a function in Unix-like operating systems that allows users to create new directories. Understanding how to implement this call provides insight into how operating systems manage file systems and directory structures.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with this repository, you will need a few tools and resources:

### Prerequisites

1. A computer with a compatible architecture (x86 or x64).
2. A working installation of Linux Lite or any Linux distribution.
3. Basic knowledge of command-line operations.
4. Familiarity with C programming language.

### Cloning the Repository

You can clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmeddfk215/Operating-system.git
```

This command will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

## Installation Instructions üì¶

Follow these steps to install Linux Lite and set up the project:

1. **Download Linux Lite**: Visit the [Linux Lite website](https://www.linuxliteos.com/download.php) to download the ISO file.

2. **Create a Bootable USB**:
   - Use tools like Rufus or Etcher to create a bootable USB drive.
   - Select the downloaded ISO file and follow the prompts to create the USB.

3. **Boot from USB**:
   - Insert the USB into your computer and restart.
   - Access the BIOS/UEFI settings to boot from the USB drive.

4. **Install Linux Lite**:
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to install Linux Lite on your machine.

5. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to your desired directory.
   - Run the clone command mentioned above.

6. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Operating-system
   ```

7. **Compile the Code**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary development tools installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   ```
   - Compile the project using:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## mkdir() System Call Implementation üõ†Ô∏è

The `mkdir()` system call is implemented in C. Below is a brief overview of how it works.

### Code Overview

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main() {
    const char *dir_name = "new_directory";
    int status = mkdir(dir_name, 0755);
    
    if (status == 0) {
        printf("Directory created successfully\n");
    } else {
        perror("Error creating directory");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Include Directives**: The program includes necessary headers for input/output and system calls.
- **Directory Name**: A constant string holds the name of the directory to be created.
- **mkdir() Call**: The `mkdir()` function attempts to create the directory with specified permissions.
- **Error Handling**: The program checks the return status of `mkdir()` and prints a message accordingly.

### Compiling and Running the Code

To compile and run the code:

1. Save the code in a file named `mkdir_example.c`.
2. Use the following command to compile:
   ```bash
   gcc mkdir_example.c -o mkdir_example
   ```
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./mkdir_example
   ```

## Usage üìã

After setting up the project, you can create directories using the implemented `mkdir()` function. Modify the directory name in the code to create different directories as needed.

### Example Commands

- To create a directory named `test_dir`, change the `dir_name` variable:
```c
const char *dir_name = "test_dir";
```

- Recompile and run the program to see the new directory created.
